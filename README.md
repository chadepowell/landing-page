# Landing Page

This was a practice project, where I developed a landing page with a responsive navigation bar, an enticing hero section including a "Get Started" button, and carefully positioned images. Overcoming the challenge of seamless navigation on smaller screens, I implemented a refined JavaScript solution for a smooth menu transition, ensuring a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices
